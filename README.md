STEM Simulations and Games

SimFlask is a crowdsourced library for Teachers who are looking for engaging STEM content involving simulations, experiments and games for their students.  

Teachers can also create such activities using ChatGPT for free and upload them here. 

Sample prompt for ChatGPT+ - "Create a simulation involving a pendulum motion using matter.js library. The HTML should have a top section
that has a a h1 tag inside body with content "Motion of Pendulum". Underneath it show 3-4 bullet points about the concepts in physics. Below it 
should be a canvas with pendulum swinging with an initial angle theta defaulted to 30 degrees. Underneath it show the control panel used to controls the 
pendulum motion such as initial angle, length of the pendulum, gravity, mass of the bob. Use the parameters to compute the time period and display it. In 
the end, show all the controls used to calculate time in a tabular form with parameter names and values in columns.  Package everything i.e. HTML, JS and CSS 
as a zip file for download. "
